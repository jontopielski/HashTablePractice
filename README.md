# HashTablePractice

Created a Simple Hash Table for fun/practice. You can insert, lookup, and delete and specify a size.

It makes use of scanner input in a loop so you can keep inserting/deleting items until you specify you are done with the program.

What I learned: try/catch exception handling practice, overriding default Object methods, encapsulation / preferred usage of getters, helper methods
