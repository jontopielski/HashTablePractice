# HashTablePractice

Created a Simple Hash Table for fun/practice. You can insert, lookup, and delete and specify a size.

It makes use of scanner input in a loop so you can keep inserting/deleting items until you specify you are done with the program.

What I learned: try/catch exception handling practice, overriding default Object methods, encapsulation / preferred usage of getters, helper methods

EDIT 03/16/2015:  Took out 'else' statements from the primary insertion/deletion/lookup functions to avoid messy code and pyramid-like if elses such as if { { else {{{ }}}}}}.. Looks better!

# Special thanks to Brian Jordan of Coding for Interviews for hash table tips and looking at my code ;)
